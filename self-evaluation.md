# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

The each method is useful based on the simplciity of being able to take action on each element even though weve only written the code for it once.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

I would still like to practice some iteration specifics and learn arrays a bit more in depth. I am going to head over to the Ruby Docs for 3.1.4 to get a better grasp on both.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

My approach on the assignment is similar to all of the assignments so far in Mod 0. I am always diligent about finishing the practice problems through the lesson and by the end the assignment is a review over the practice so its a comfortable difficulty if I follow along and take notes like I have been.
